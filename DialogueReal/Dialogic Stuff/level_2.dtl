Killer: Well yes. I can certainly see your intelligence is intact.
Killer: But... how do I say this... isn’t this kind of boring???

Killer: I’m literally so disappointed in myself for picking you as my target. Come to think of it, there was a bald guy with a beard and glasses that looked pretty hot... he even selled those tasty blue thingies. Shoulda picked him instead. Or that sexy triolingo owl. Mmmmmmm.
Killer: Oh I’m sorry I forgot that you were still here.
