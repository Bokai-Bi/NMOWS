Killer (Default): Well yes. I can certainly see your intelligence is intact.
Killer: But... how do I say this... isn’t this kind of boring???
Killer (killer_angry): I like my target STRONG! CHALLENGING!! MYSTERIOUS!!!
Killer: A treat to kill when I hear the blood-curdling screams..! Yes!! WRITHING! WRIGGLING!
Killer: You’re the kind of person to just get, like, killed when i sink that knife in, are you?
Killer: I’m literally so disappointed in myself for picking you as my target. Come to think of it, there was a bald guy with a beard and glasses that looked pretty hot...
Killer: He even selled those tasty blue thingies. Shoulda picked him instead. Or that sexy triolingo owl. Mmmmmmm.
Killer: Oh I’m sorry I forgot that you were still here.
